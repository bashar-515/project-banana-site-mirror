    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>
      <i>Project Banana</i> is a no-frills live video chat app that boasts an
      emphasis on simplicity and privacy: no accounts, no downloads—just an easy
      way to connect with your favorite friend(s). Create a room, share it with
      someone, and you'll be well on your way to chatting with them using
      internet magic!

    <p>
      Under the hood, Project banana uses WebRTC and custom signaling logic to
      efficiently form a peer-to-peer connection between clients. The backend
      consists of a Go server listening for ICE candidates and session
      descriptions via gRPC—forwarding them to peers over a WebSocket
      connection. The entire setup is deployed on Docker containers and runs on
      a Raspberry Pi located in my bedroom, and I'm using
      <a href="https://www.noip.com">No-IP</a> to manage my dynamic IP address.
      The app's frontend is served using GitHub Pages. Check out the source code
